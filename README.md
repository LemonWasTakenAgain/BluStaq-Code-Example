  - Stockbot 
  - Vex Disco Spinup Pikes Peak Early College (PPEC) Semi Qualifier Robot Code

 - Stockbot:
    Stockbot is a project inspired by my brother who a long time ago got me into coding. Stockbot is an algorithm that looks at the past few days of stock exchanges and predicts the events of the slope and with each day that a stock goes up or day the multiplier increases. The project was made significantly easier due to the Alpaca api however the official and most unnoffical sources were incorrect for the format. After figuring out the api on my own the Discord integration so far is the next hardest hurtle so far it can display cash balance and a few other things but the issue is making it look nice in discord. Some final notes I have posted 3 versions of the code due to its unstability but it has shown returns of ~.05% daily with paper cash I inted to return to this project with a fresh mind and AI implementation very soon.
    
 - Vex Disco Spinup Code:
   Vex Spinup is an event held by vex an overall robotics introductory scene. On a state scale a school will host the event and a bunch of other schools will come and compete for first place in a given event taht rotates each year and the competitions are held 3x a year. This year we had to make a robot that could launch discs into a hoop to earn points, drag them under ours to earn points or spin rollers around the arena, it was a two on two tournament. My job was to code the robot to effectively communicate with the controller and teach the driver how the code worked with his robot. The struggle this year was that we had used the official schmatic yet in it was too weak to turn the rollers or launch the discs into the hoop we found many other teams met this struggle, so we improvised by pushing the discs under our net whilsts they were distracted by their weak bots. In conclusion an overview would show that this project was difficult at the part of explaining the controls and learning C++ to code it, but it was fun in the long run and we plan to rebuild for the next event in November.
